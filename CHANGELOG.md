# OwnTV Core — Changelog

> Release notes: two parts per version — New features (by name) and Fixes. This file feeds the GitHub
> release body. Tags are prefixed `core-`; a core version never lines up with a TV or mobile app version.
>
> **Rule: bullet points only — no descriptions.** Each line is a short bolded feature/fix title and
> nothing more. The only extra detail ever allowed is a contribution credit for community work. A
> release that changes the database, backup format or anything a consuming app must adapt to says so
> in one bolded line of its own (e.g. **Database v46 · Backup v24 · Breaking**). The detail — what,
> why, files and verification — belongs in the commit message, never here.
